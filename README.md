## Abstract 
In this paper, we propose a capsule network called COVID-WideNet for diagnosing COVID-19 cases using Chest X-ray (CXR) images. Experimental results have demonstrated that a discriminative trained, multi-layer capsule network achieves state-of-the-art performance on the COVIDx dataset. In particular, COVID-WideNet performs better than any other CNN based approaches for the diagnosis of COVID-19 infected patients. Further, the proposed COVID-WideNet has the number of trainable parameters that is 20 times less than that of other CNN based models. This results in a fast and efficient diagnosing COVID-19 symptoms, and with achieving the 0.95 of Area Under Curve (AUC), 91% of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity, respectively. This may also assist radiologists to detect COVID and its variant like delta.
